# Game of Life in python

A simple implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in python, with an emphasis on intuitive code and ease rather than efficiency.

Example usage:
```python
animate_life(universe_size=(100, 100), seed='infinite', seed_position=(40, 40),
             n_generations=500, interval=50, save=True)
```
