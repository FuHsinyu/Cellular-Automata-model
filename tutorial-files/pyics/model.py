# A model may have any number of parameters, which can be changed from outside
# the model (e.g. by a GUI). Using this base a model can easily define these
# parameters, and allows both the model itself and the outside code to easily
# access them.

           then be used from other code (such as a GUI) to get all parameters.
        2) Create a property with getter and setter, which then allows further
           code to use the variable as it normally would. The setter of the
           property makes sure the parameter is always the correct type and can
           optionally call a user-defined setter.

        The code can be used as follows:

            ...         Model.__init__(self)

        The actual variable in which the value is stored (and which the property
        accesses) is called _param_VARNAME, and should not be used directly.
